                        <p>With 6+ years of experience building production AI systems across embedded/edge
                            devices, on-premise servers, and cloud platforms. I specialize in Computer Vision and LLM
                            applications, with a strong focus on high-performance optimization turning research-grade
                            models into reliable, low-latency products.</p>
                        <p>
                            Over the years, I’ve worked across multiple domains including construction technology,
                            service automation, aquaculture monitoring, and industrial robotics.
                            I also build LLM-powered applications such as chatbots and RAG systems that turn
                            unstructured documents into usable,
                            searchable knowledge for teams and products.
                        </p>
                        <p>I’m motivated by using technology and robotics to make real life easier-helping people work
                            faster, reduce repetitive tasks, and make better decisions.
                            I focus on building systems that remain reliable under real-world constraints, not only in
                            ideal settings.</p>
